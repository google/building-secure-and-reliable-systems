<h1>Implementing Systems</h1>
<p>Once you’ve analyzed and designed your systems, it’s time to implement your plans. In some cases, implementation might mean buying an off-the-shelf solution. <a data-type="xref" href="#case_study_designingcomma_implementi">#case_study_designingcomma_implementi</a> provides one example of Google’s thought process in deciding to build a custom software solution.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#implementing_systems">#implementing_systems</a> of this book focuses on integrating security and reliability during the implementation phase of the software development lifecycle. <a data-type="xref" href="#writing_code">#writing_code</a> reiterates the idea that frameworks will simplify your systems. Adding static analysis and fuzzing during testing, as described in <a data-type="xref" href="#onethree_testing_code">#onethree_testing_code</a>, will harden the code. <a data-type="xref" href="#onefour_deploying_code">#onefour_deploying_code</a> discusses why you should also invest in verifiable builds and further controls—safeguards around coding, building, and testing have limited effect if adversaries can bypass them by reaching your production environment.</p>
<p>Even if your entire software supply chain is resilient to security and reliability failures, you’ll inevitably need to analyze your systems when problems arise. <a data-type="xref" href="#onefive_investigating_systems">#onefive_investigating_systems</a> discusses the careful balance you must strike between granting appropriate debugging access and the security requirements of storing and accessing logs.</p>
