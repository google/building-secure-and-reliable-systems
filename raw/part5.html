<h1>Organization and Culture</h1>
<p>While the engineering practices highlighted in this book will help your organization build secure and reliable systems, your efforts will be effective only if your entire organization is invested in a culture of security and reliability. Culture is a powerful and unique defining component of every organization, and you should not underestimate its role in your ability to institute change.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#organization_and_culture">Part V</a> of this book focuses on cultural aspects of implementing the approaches presented thus far. Chrome was one of the first products at Google to have a dedicated security team, actively promoting a security-centric culture. We start with a case study of that team, focusing on its role in Chromeâ€™s popularity and success. In <a data-type="xref" href='ch20.html#twozero_understanding_roles_and_respons'>Chapter 20</a>, we posit that everyone in an organization is responsible for security and reliability. The role of security specialists should be to implement security-specific technologies that require specialist knowledge, and to devise best practices, policies, and training. <a data-type="xref" href='ch21.html#twoone_building_a_culture_of_security_a'>Chapter 21</a> rounds out the book with a discussion of strategies for fostering a healthy culture of security and reliability.</p>
