<h1>Introductory Material</h1>
<p>If you asked your customers to name their favorite features of your products, it’s unlikely that their lists would begin with security and reliability. Both features are often hidden in their expectations: if they’re working well, your customers don’t notice them.</p>
<p>We believe that security and reliability <em>should</em> be top priorities for any organization. Ultimately, few people want to use a product that’s not secure and reliable, so these aspects provide differentiating business value.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#introductory_material">Part I</a> of this book highlights the large overlap between practices that are fundamental to secure and reliable systems, and tradeoffs you might have to make between the two. We then provide high-level guidance on your potential adversaries: how they might act, and how their actions might affect the lifecycle of your systems.</p>
