<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>We wrote this book because we believe there is a significant overlap in the technologies and practices that protect systems and keep them reliable, and that organizations should integrate the concepts of security and reliability throughout the process of designing, implementing, and maintaining systems. Whereas traditionally they have been treated as separate disciplines, our view is that security and reliability are inherent properties of a system, and they are therefore the responsibility of everyone involved in the project lifecycle. Many technology shifts are well underway that we believe will inspire organizations to take this view.</p>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Fourth Industrial Revolution" data-type="indexterm" id="ch22.html_ix1">&nbsp;</a>This technology revolution—what some have deemed the Fourth Industrial Revolution—is altering the world as we know it. This shift is being felt not only by consumers, in the form of more sophisticated products, but also by the developers who are producing these products. Organizations are increasingly reliant on technology, even if it’s not the core of their business. For example, we’re seeing systems that let surgeons perform surgery on patients located on the opposite side of the world. Scientists are using autonomous flying vehicles to survey archaeological sites, study the effects of soil erosion, and protect endangered species. Robots are being deployed to perform dangerous work in space and at nuclear disaster sites.</p>
<p>The expanding connectedness of technology means we are growing more dependent on the reliability of those solutions. As we extend our data surfaces to third parties, we need confidence that it’s safe to do so. The trust we build with people is based on the reliability and security of the technologies on which we choose to run our infrastructure. This is true for organizations of any size, from a three-person open source project that thousands of other projects rely upon to a large multinational corporation selling a product to a global user base.</p>
<p>The complexity of modern systems, and the velocity at which they are developed, means that safety and reliability need to be integrated from a product’s inception for maximum effectiveness. Seeing security and reliability as inherent properties of a <span class="keep-together">system</span> is not only natural but critical in today’s automated, connected, and complex technological landscape.</p>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="DevOps" data-type="indexterm" id="ch22.html_ix2">&nbsp;</a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="DevSecOps" data-type="indexterm" id="ch22.html_ix3">&nbsp;</a>It’s no surprise, then, that within the broader community, DevOps and DevSecOps are driving the conversations around the sustainability of systems. However, the notion of an integrated security and reliability model will take time to evolve and become a natural part of the ecosystem. Many development lifecycles and organizations are functionally centered around the division of labor between teams responsible for the development, testing, security, reliability, and operation of a system. This model will need to transform to meet the demands of the technology shifts we are seeing.</p>
<p>In writing this book, we brought together teams from across Google—from developers to SREs to security engineers. This collaboration reflects the interactive spirit Google relies on to secure its systems and make them increasingly reliable. At Google, we make security and reliability concerns part of the product development process, and encourage people with different experiences and skills to work together and listen to the perspective that others bring. Because the people are as important as the systems themselves, we recommend investing thoughtfully in how you design your teams and structure their responsibilities and incentives. People need to agree on common requirements before they debate technical solutions for which consensus might be difficult to achieve. Don’t underestimate the investment required to build trust and ensure you’re all speaking a common language.</p>
<p>For those who are passionate about security and reliability, we conclude with the following advice: your ability to work across knowledge domains and embed expertise in the right places is key to your organization’s success. Security and reliability need to be an integrated part of the entire computing environment. All these pieces must work together in harmony to solve problems. No checklist or silver-bullet advice we could give can compensate for your own ability to help your organization flex and grow as the nature of the security and reliability challenges it faces evolves.</p>
<p>As we come to the end of this book, we anticipate that it will mark the beginning of many important conversations. We hope you will join in this discussion too, by participating in communities with other professionals and sharing your stories. In this dialogue, we encourage you to honor the many viewpoints that different roles bring to the table, support the search for solutions, and share what has worked for you. We’re confident that this conversation will help all of us in our effort to create secure and reliable systems.</p>
