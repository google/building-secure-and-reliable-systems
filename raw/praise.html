<h1>Praise for "Building Secure and Reliable Systems"</h1>


<blockquote>
  <p>It is very hard to get practical advice on how to build and operate trustworthy infrastructure at the scale of billions of users. This book is the first to really capture the knowledge of some of the best security and reliability teams in the world, and while very few companies will need to operate at Google's scale many engineers and operators can benefit from some of the hard-earned lessons on securing wide-flung distributed systems. This book is full of useful insights from cover to cover, and each example and anecdote is heavy with authenticity and the wisdom that comes from experimenting, failing and measuring real outcomes at scale. It is a must for anybody looking to build their systems the correct way from day one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This book is a rare treat for industry veterans and novices alike: instead of teaching information security as a discipline of its own, the authors offer hard-wrought and richly illustrated advice for building software and operations that actually stood the test of time. In doing so, they make a compelling case for reliability, usability, and security going hand-in-hand as the entirely inseparable underpinnings of good system design.</p>

  <p>Google faces some of the toughest security challenges of any company, and they're revealing their guiding security principles in this book. If you're in SRE or security <span class="keep-together">and curious</span> as to how a hyperscaler builds security into their systems from design <span class="keep-together">through operation, this book is worth studying</span>.</p>

  <p>If you're responsible for operating or securing an internet service: caution! Google and others have made it look too easy. It's not. I had the privilege of working with these <span class="keep-together">book authors</span> for many years and was constantly amazed at what they uncovered and their extreme measures to protect our users' data. If you have such responsibilities yourself, or if you're just trying to understand what it takes to protect services at scale <span class="keep-together">in the modern world,</span> study this book. Nothing is covered in detail—there are other references for that—but I don't know anywhere else that you'll find the breadth of pragmatic tips <span class="keep-together">and frank discussion of tradeoffs</span>.</p>
